## üîí Security Testing Examples

### Basic Security Headers Test
```typescript
test('should verify security headers', async ({ page }) => {
  const response = await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const headers = response?.headers();
  
  expect(headers?.['x-frame-options']).toBeDefined();
  expect(headers?.['x-content-type-options']).toBe('nosniff');
  expect(headers?.['strict-transport-security']).toBeDefined();
});
```

### XSS Protection Test
```typescript
test('should prevent XSS attacks', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com/search');
  await page.fill('input[name="q"]', '<script>alert("XSS")</script>');
  await page.press('input[name="q"]', 'Enter');
  
  const content = await page.content();
  expect(content).not.toContain('<script>alert("XSS")</script>');
});
```

### Automated Reconnaissance
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function scanWebsite(url) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Extract security information
  const response = await page.goto(url);
  const headers = response.headers();
  const technologies = await page.evaluate(() => {
    // Detect technologies, frameworks, etc.
  });
  
  await browser.close();
  return { headers, technologies };
}
```

## üö® Security Considerations

### Ethical Usage
This template includes powerful security tools that should only be used for:
- **Authorized testing** on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Educational purposes** in controlled environments
- **Bug bounty programs** within their defined scope
- **Security research** following responsible disclosure practices

### Legal Compliance
- Always obtain proper authorization before testing
- Respect terms of service and legal boundaries
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Maintain detailed documentation of testing activities

### Best Practices
- Use isolated test environments when possible
- Keep tools and signatures updated
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security reviews of your testing environment

## ü§ù Contributing & Customization

### Adding Custom Tools
1. Modify the `setup.sh` script to include additional tools
2. Update the `devcontainer.json` for new VS Code extensions
3. Add new test examples to the appropriate directories

### Extending Security Tests
1. Create new test files in `tests/security/`
2. Implement custom security check functions
3. Add automation scripts to `scripts/` directories

### Configuration Customization
1. Modify `playwright.config.ts` for testing preferences
2. Update `package.json` for additional dependencies
3. Customize the workspace structure as needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Browser Installation Fails**
```bash
# Manually install browsers
playwright install --with-deps
```

**Permission Denied for Security Tools**
```bash
# Ensure running as root
whoami  # Should return 'root'
```

**Network Tools Not Working**
```bash
# Check network capabilities
ip addr show
ping google.com
```

**Playwright Tests Timeout**
```bash
# Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
timeout: 30000  # 30 seconds
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use `--headed` mode sparingly (slower)
- Implement proper test parallelization
- Cache browser installations between builds
- Use lightweight test fixtures
